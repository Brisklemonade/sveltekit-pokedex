## Overview

Svelte was chosen for this project because it is a "rich, state-model-based ES6 component framework" with few dependencies, requiring only html, javascript, and CSS. There are no client-side dependencies, once compiled with svelte; it's just plain JS.

Svelte is a simple compiler that allows you to create a reactive, stateful, and dependency-free web application in pure javascript.

Furthermore, the Svelte API is so simple and well-designed that you can learn it from scratch in no time at all!
